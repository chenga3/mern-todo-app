# Todo List Web Application
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Code is based off a MERN stack tutorial from CodingTheSmartWay.com - link: https://codingthesmartway.com/the-mern-stack-tutorial-building-a-react-crud-application-from-start-to-finish-part-1/

Current functionality:
- List current todos
- Create a new todo

For app functionality to work, a MongoDB database called 'todos' must be running on localhost port 27017.

Future ideas:
- Extend app into a study planner with customisable options such as due date, subject, study category etc.
- Add calendar so users can assign todos to certain days
- Add pomodoro timer

## Running the Application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## CWF Experience

- How to connect MongoDB to an application using mongoose
- How to use the npm package manager

### Biggest challenges?
- Understanding all the files bootstrapped with create-react-app
- Getting the MongoDB server up and running on my machine
- Juggling working on this on top of uni work
